* changing names when doing a PUT has undefined behavior.

* the regular expression for name validation should use + instead of *.

* when doing a copy & paste of session XML, can copy & paste
  source-images XML. But there are no binaries associated with this. What
  should the behavior be?

* When submitting non-wellformed XML to a place where the method is
  not allowed, return 405 method not allowed or 400 bad request? Right
  now it's the latter.
